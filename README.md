## General Info
Team Bot is a digital assistant for Discord, created for group collaboration on coding projects and assignments. This bot was created using JavaScript, Node.js, and the Discord.js module. 

Discord is a powerful and accessible tool for software developers to collaborate on projects. The inspiration for Team Bot arose when I was the project manager of an academic coding project. There was not a simple way to manage a team's communication and version control. 

Team Bot takes an object-oriented approach to creating commands, using a collection-based design to dynamically retrieve and execute commands. Each command is modularized in it's individual file. Team Bot is also used in collaboration with web hooks to automate GitHub notifications.
